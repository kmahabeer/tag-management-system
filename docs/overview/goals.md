# Goals

The Tagging Service is built to support:

- **Flexible classification**: One tag can belong to multiple categories or roles.
- **Contextual rendering**: Tags are grouped and presented differently depending on the assetâ€™s purpose.
- **Relationship mapping**: Tags can be nested, related, or composed.
- **UI independence**: Although this system does not create or render the UI, its structure is designed to serve downstream UI tools.
- **Extensibility**: The model supports evolving relationships (e.g., "very fast car") and is adaptable to new domains.

> This service exposes an API for managing all tag-related operations: creation, updates, deletion, linking, and querying of tags and their relationships.
