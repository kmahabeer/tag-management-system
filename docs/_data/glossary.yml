entity: |
  An 'entity' is the generic name for something that is managed by a Asset
  Management System. Entities are identified by an Entity Reference. We 
  choose the term 'entity' as some systems give a specific meaning to an 
  'asset', such that all assets are entities, but not all entities are assets. 

  As a simplified example, an 'asset' may always require to exist in some 
  organizational hierarchy, and be the only thing that can be version managed. 
  An entity however, can refer to anything that the Asset Management System 
  knows about, including a part of the organizational hierarchy, or a specific 
  version or component part of an 'asset'. In the core API, entities hold data 
  for one or more traits. Traits have an id, and zero or more properties holding 
  simple value types. This makes it relatively straightforward for an Asset Management 
  System to provide support for any entity that a host may wish to store, by simply 
  storing and retrieving these three properties from its persistent store. 

  If it wishes, or understands specific entity traits, it can always provide more 
  sophisticated mappings to its own internal types, to provide a better user experience.
